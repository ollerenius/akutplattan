CACHE MANIFEST
# Version 0.2.2

# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
# All files that are to be cached must be specified       #
# in this file. Luckily, most files are compiled and      #
# packaged in such a way that the manifest does not       #
# need to change in order to cache them. However,         #
# all assets (images, etc.) must be specified explicitly  #
# here as they are added to the application.              #
